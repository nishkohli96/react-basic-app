Learning the fundamentals of [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) by creating a sample app with the following features -

- Absolute Import modules by adding jsconfig.json file. Check this [Thread](https://medium.com/@suraj.93p/creating-path-aliases-in-create-react-app-with-react-app-rewired-c2cde81b472) and also this  [Link](https://medium.com/hackernoon/absolute-imports-with-create-react-app-4c6cfb66c35d). 
- Working with [different env files](https://medium.com/better-programming/managing-environments-for-provisional-builds-with-react-app-1fb411e3597) 
- Fetching data from a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) Server
- Add [Pre-Commit Hook](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) with [Eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) & [Prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier)
- UI design using [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/)
- Theming & Styles using [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- To-Do List using [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) and [Redux Persist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-persist)
- Minifying images, css files using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) Plugins
- Internationalization using [react-i18-next](https://react.i18next.com/)
- Query Data from [Contentful GraphQL API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/general/graphql/)
- Use [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) as an easier alternative to Redux for global state management
- Remember to add .env variables from your file to the Netlify env-vars under Build & deploy
  of your app settings. Netlify takes care of the CI/CD part.   
- Check out [trianglify.io](https://trianglify.io/) and 
  [cssgradient.io](https://cssgradient.io/) for background image ideas and gradient ideas. 
- Implement [FullCalendar.io](https://fullcalendar.io/) with [MomentJS](https://momentjs.com/)
- Use [React Day Picker](https://react-day-picker.js.org/) and [React Multi Date Picker](https://shahabyazdi.github.io/react-multi-date-picker/)
- Integrated with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Please check out my [learn-gatsby-tailwind](https://github.com/nishkohli96/learn-gastby-tailwind) or [react-libs](https://github.com/nishkohli96/react-libs) repository for complete config and usage of Tailwind CSS.
